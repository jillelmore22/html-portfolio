<h1>Jill's Favorite Fall Movies</h1>
<h2>Here is a list of my favorite movies that are perfect for the autumn season!</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Hocus Pocus</h3>
<p>Starting off with a halloween movie, Hocus Pocus is a classic that is so entertaining and nostalgic.</p>
<h3>Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire</h3>
<p>All of the Harry Potter movies are great for the fall season, but I do like the Goblet of Fire for its interesting plot and new characters.</p>
<h3>You've Got Mail</h3>
<p>You've Got Mail is the perfect autumn rom com staring Tom Hank and Meg Ryan...what more could you ask for?</p>
